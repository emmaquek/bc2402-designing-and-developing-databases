# BC2402 – Designing and Developing Databases

This repository contains coursework and project submissions for **BC2402: Designing and Developing Databases**.  
The course focuses on designing, querying, and analysing relational and non-relational databases to support data-driven decision-making in business and public policy contexts.  
Through individual and group projects, SQL and NoSQL techniques were applied to real-world datasets to extract insights, justify decisions, and communicate findings clearly.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **MySQL** – relational database platform  
- **SQL** – querying, aggregation, and data analysis  
- **MongoDB (NoSQL)** – document-based data storage and querying  
- **NoSQLBooster for MongoDB** – NoSQL query development and exploration

## Projects Overview

### 1. Coffee Industry Database Analysis (Individual Project – SQL)

**Project Context:**  
This individual SQL project analyses the coffee industry across Southeast Asia and North America, focusing on growth patterns, outlet expansion, and consumer trends.

**Project Description:**  
Using a provided relational database, SQL queries were developed to answer analytical questions related to coffee sales, store expansion, and market characteristics. The emphasis was on writing clear, well-structured queries and explaining the logic behind each step.

**Key Applications & Methods:**
- Wrote complex SQL queries using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and aggregation functions to analyse industry trends
- Queried multiple relational tables to compare regional market characteristics
- Applied filtering and grouping logic to support business-driven analytical questions
- Used **inline SQL annotations** to clearly document query intent, logic, and interpretation
- Ensured query outputs were interpretable and aligned with real-world use cases

### 2. Nutrition, Happiness & Fast-Food Analysis (Group Project – SQL & NoSQL)

**Project Objective:**  
To explore the relationship between dietary patterns, nutritional variation, fast-food consumption, and happiness across countries and time periods.

**My Contribution:**  
I contributed to **query design, analysis, and insight generation**, including two presentation sections focused on:
- Seasonal nutrient spikes and public health interventions
- Relationships between nutrient variation and national happiness levels

**Project Description:**  
The project combined **SQL and NoSQL approaches** to analyse multiple datasets sourced from public platforms (e.g. Kaggle, Our World in Data), alongside an **additional dataset independently sourced (`fastfood.csv`)** to enrich the analysis.

**Key Applications & Methods:**
- Used **SQL** to query structured nutritional and country-level datasets, applying joins, aggregations, and conditional filtering
- Applied **NoSQL concepts using MongoDB** to manage and explore heterogeneous and semi-structured data
- Designed queries to support hypothesis-driven analysis rather than descriptive reporting
- Integrated multiple datasets (provided and self-sourced) into a coherent analytical pipeline
- Translated database query outputs into validated analytical findings
