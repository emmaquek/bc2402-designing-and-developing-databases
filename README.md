# BC2402 – Designing and Developing Databases

This repository contains coursework and project submissions for **BC2402: Designing and Developing Databases**.  
The course focuses on designing, querying, and analysing relational and non-relational databases to support data-driven decision-making in business and public policy contexts.  
Through individual and group projects, SQL and NoSQL techniques were applied to real-world datasets to extract insights, justify decisions, and communicate findings clearly.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Coffee Industry Database Analysis (Individual Project – SQL)

**Project Context:**  
This individual SQL project analyses the coffee industry across Southeast Asia and North America, focusing on growth patterns, outlet expansion, and consumer trends.

**Project Description:**  
Using a provided relational database, SQL queries were developed to answer analytical questions related to coffee sales, store expansion, and market characteristics. The emphasis was on writing clear, well-structured queries and explaining the logic behind each step.

**Key Applications & Methods:**
- Queried multiple related tables to analyse outlet counts, sales-related indicators, and geographic distribution
- Used joins and aggregation functions to compare industry trends across regions
- Structured queries to answer business-driven questions rather than isolated technical tasks
- Included **inline SQL annotations** to clearly explain query logic, assumptions, and interpretations
- Interpreted query outputs in a business and market context

### 2. Nutrition, Happiness & Fast-Food Analysis (Group Project – SQL & NoSQL)

**Project Objective:**  
To explore the relationship between dietary patterns, nutritional variation, fast-food consumption, and happiness across countries and time periods.

**My Contribution:**  
I contributed to **query design, analysis, and insight generation**, including two presentation sections focused on:
- Seasonal nutrient spikes and public health interventions
- Relationships between nutrient variation and national happiness levels

**Project Description:**  
The project combined **SQL and NoSQL approaches** to analyse multiple datasets sourced from public platforms (e.g. Kaggle, Our World in Data), alongside an **additional dataset independently sourced (`fastfood.csv`)** to enrich the analysis.

**Key Applications & Methods:**
- Analysed nutritional intake data to identify seasonal patterns and consumption trends
- Examined relationships between nutrient variation and happiness indicators across countries
- Integrated both provided datasets and an independently sourced dataset (`fastfood.csv`) to enrich the analysis
- Applied SQL for structured querying and NoSQL concepts for handling heterogeneous data
- Generated insights with relevance to public health and policy discussions
